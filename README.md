# TestIS4Azure

This fails with OptionsValidationException: The 'Instance' option must be provided.

I would like to use IS4 server and also have a web front end that uses AzureAD to authenticate to manage clients/resources etc

The site works without IS4. It works without AzureAD. But together it errors.
